Line 1 : File type and version information
Line 2 : Geodetic Datum used for the Lat/Lon positions for each trackpoint
Line 3 : "Altitude is in feet" - just a reminder that the altitude is always stored in feet
Line 4 : Reserved for future use
Line 5 : multiple fields as below

    Field 1 : always zero (0)
    Field 2 : width of track plot line on screen - 1 or 2 are usually the best
    Field 3 : track color (RGB)
    Field 4 : track description (no commas allowed)
    Field 5 : track skip value - reduces number of track points plotted, usually set to 1
    Field 6 : track type - 0 = normal , 10 = closed polygon , 20 = Alarm Zone
    Field 7 : track fill style - 0 =bsSolid; 1 =bsClear; 2 =bsBdiagonal; 3 =bsFdiagonal; 4 =bsCross;
    5 =bsDiagCross; 6 =bsHorizontal; 7 =bsVertical;
    Field 8 : track fill color (RGB)

Line 6 : Number of track points in the track, not used, the number of points is determined when reading the points file 

Track points:
Field 1 : Latitude - decimal degrees.
Field 2 : Longitude - decimal degrees.
Field 3 : Code - 0 if normal, 1 if break in track line
Field 4 : Altitude in feet (-777 if not valid)
Field 5 : Date - see Date Format below, if blank a preset date will be used
Field 6 : Date as a string
Field 7 : Time as a string

Date Format

Delphi stores date and time values in the TDateTime type. The integral part of a TDateTime value is the number of days that have passed since 12/30/1899. The fractional part of a TDateTime value is the time of day.

Following are some examples of TDateTime values and their corresponding dates and times:

0 - 12/30/1899 12:00 am
2.75 - 1/1/1900 6:00 pm
